Wasserstoff Application
Overview
Wasserstoff is a React application designed to provide visual representations of data related to sales figures, earnings, trends, and statistics. It utilizes various libraries and components to create an interactive and informative user experience.

Code Structure
The codebase follows a modular structure, with each component responsible for a specific functionality. Here's a brief overview of the provided components:

Popup Component: Displays sales figures with a dynamic chart.
Design Component: Provides visual representations of data related to earnings and presentations.
Data Overview Component: Offers a timeline view and information about trends and statistics.
ToolTip Component: Displays contextual information with icons.
PieChartCircle Component: Renders a customizable pie chart with motion effects.
Flow of Code
Entry Point: The application starts from an entry point file, such as index.js or App.js, where the main React component is rendered into the DOM.
Component Hierarchy: Components are organized hierarchically, with parent components containing child components.
Component Interactions: Components interact with each other through props and state, passing data and functions down to child components.
Data Fetching: Components fetch data asynchronously, processing it before passing it down to child components for rendering.
Rendering: Components render UI elements based on the data they receive as props, including dynamic content like charts or lists.
Event Handling: Components respond to user interactions by updating state or triggering side effects, typically defined within components.
Styling: Components are styled using CSS or preprocessor stylesheets, scoped to individual components to prevent style conflicts.
Animation and Motion Effects: Motion effects enhance the user experience, applied to UI elements using libraries like Framer Motion or CSS animations.
Component Reusability: Components are designed to be reusable and modular, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
